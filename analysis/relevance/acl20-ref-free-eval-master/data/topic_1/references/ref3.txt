Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his SUV onto Glendale train tracks in a suicide attempt. When his SUV got stuck between the tracks he got out and left. A southbound Metrolink commuter train crashed into the immovable SUV and climbed over it. The front cab car rammed into an adjacent stationary Union Pacific work train and toppled it. The remaining cars jackknifed and derailed a northbound Metrolink commuter train. The accident and subsequent fire killed 11 and injured 200. Alvarez watched the crash then attempted suicide again by slashing his wrists and stabbing himself. He was arrested and charged with homicide.
