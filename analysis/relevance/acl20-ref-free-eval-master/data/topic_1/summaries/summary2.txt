Until Wednesday, Juan Manuel Alvarez was living the average life of an obscure and troubled man.It had to be the worst multicasualty incident Ive been to, Los Angeles Fire Capt. Rick Godinez said.David Morrison, 47, an attorney, was heading to downtown Los Angeles on his regular morning commute. With his tire, apparently caught between the tracks, Mr. Alvarez jumped out of the Jeep and ran. But, Mrs. Alvarez was tracked to a modest home in the north section of Compton. In filing the charges, Cooley said he was unmoved by Alvarezs emotional state before the crash.
