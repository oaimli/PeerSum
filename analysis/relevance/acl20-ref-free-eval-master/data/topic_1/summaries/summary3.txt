Authorities believe Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee around the rail crossing barrier and onto the Metrolink train tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale about 6 a.m. Wednesday. A 25-year-old man was arrested following Wednesday's commuter train collision that killed at least 10 people near downtown Los Angeles. He apparently changed his mind about killing himself, abandoned the vehicle and watched the crash, the Glendale police chief, Randy G. Adams, said. Alvarez is accused of leaving a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, causing the derailment of one train, which then crashed into another.
