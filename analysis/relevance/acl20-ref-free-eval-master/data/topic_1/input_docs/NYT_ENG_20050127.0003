COMMUTER TRAIN CRASH LEAVES 11 DEAD, SCORES INJURED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GLENDALE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "deranged" man abandoned his SUV on railroad
tracks when he aborted a suicide attempt, authorities said, and
then watched as a Metrolink commuter train slammed into it,
setting off a spectacular three-train collision that left at 11
least dead and more than 180 injured Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 6 a.m., commuters were thrown flying through the cars
and trapped beneath tons of twisted metal as the double-deck
rail cars toppled and flames danced around them.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the Jeep Grand Cherokee on the tracks, the front
of southbound Train 100 hurtled into a Union Pacific locomotive
parked on a parallel track, while its other cars swept
into oncoming northbound Train 901.
</P>
<P>
Even before a massive emergency response effort was launched, nearby residents
and workers rushed to help passengers, many of them dazed
and bleeding as they stumbled from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete outrage," Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca said
in angry comments at a news conference. "The people who
ride trains to Los Angeles deserve better than this.
</P>
<P>
"That an individual would deliberately put their car on tracks, cause
a train derailment, affect the lives of hundreds of people
and, in effect, kill people, this is a tragedy we
will certainly mourn."
</P>
<P>
Among the nine men and two women killed were a uniformed
sheriff's deputy headed to work, several government employees and one
of the conductors.
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of Compton, the driver of the Jeep
Grand Cherokee, was found near the wreckage and arrested on
suspicion of homicide.
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams said Alvarez -- who officials said
had tried to commit suicide earlier by slashing his wrists
and cutting himself -- watched the chaos after fleeing his
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
"This whole incident started by a deranged individual who was suicidal,"
Adams said. "He was very distraught and upset and realized
he caused a major disaster."
</P>
<P>
Passengers described being hurled from their seats as the trains collided,
and then rescuing one another from the wreckage in the
predawn dark. A fire broke out, and 5,000 gallons of
diesel fuel spilled.
</P>
<P>
"People just flew out of their seats and hit the walls,"
said Bernan Castro, a Washington Mutual insurance agent who had
boarded the southbound train in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
"We smelled the fire. ... It was engulfing (one fourth of)
the train. It just looked like a war zone. ...
There was blood everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Doug Parsons of Northridge also was aboard the train, headed for
his job at the Metropolitan Water District downtown.
</P>
<P>
"We were right on schedule. Right in here, we usually pass
another train. We heard some gravel fly and then ...
the big boom. The car in front of us went
sideways. ... That's when we saw the other train."
</P>
<P>
Tracy West of Northridge, who suffered serious cuts to her right
leg, described a nightmarish scene:
</P>
<P>
"I just remember flipping and flipping and flipping. ... My feet
were over my head. People were hurt, dripping with blood.
You just offer to help anyone you can."
</P>
<P>
On the northbound train, headed from Union Station to Burbank, Nelson
Goyzueta said he watched the rail car in front of
his rock back and forth on the track before toppling
to the side.
</P>
<P>
"The third one did cartwheels -- it was way off to
the side," said Goyzueta, who was on his way to
work with other employees of Senior Aerospace in Burbank. "It
was mayhem."
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board and other government agencies sent investigators.
</P>
<P>
The tracks run next to a big-box shopping center anchored by
a Costco, where triage was set up and store workers
helped with the rescue.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of firefighters descended on the scene within minutes of the
6:02 a.m. crash, dousing flames, spraying foam on the fuel
spill and extricating wounded from the cars.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters described a horrific scene where bloodied passengers were helping each
other off the train and responders could hear the cries
for help.
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable -- all you could think was, 'Go in
and get those people out,' " said firefighter Oscar Stokes,
38. "There was a lot of blood."
</P>
<P>
Rescuers used extrication tools to cut out those trapped in the
wreckage and shopping carts from Costco to wheel victims to
triage until more gurneys arrived.
</P>
<P>
Dogs were brought in to search for survivors and cameras to
probe dark crevices in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of paramedic trucks formed single-file lines to quickly load and
carry the wounded to 16 area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
They treated and transported 123 victims, including 70 in critical condition.
They assessed and released 60 others at the scene.
</P>
<P>
"It had to be the worst multicasualty incident I've been to,"
Los Angeles Fire Capt. Rick Godinez said. "It was a
devastating sight.
</P>
<P>
"We could see walking wounded. We knew we had a pretty
traumatic situation."
</P>
<P>
Elected officials expressed outrage at the tragedy but praised the rescue
effort that reached across jurisdictions to handle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Words can't describe, when you look into the cars, the violence
of the crash," Mayor James Hahn said at a news
conference. "It's a miracle that more people didn't die."
</P>
<P>
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent his own condolences and those of his
wife, Maria Shriver, to the victims and survivors.
</P>
<P>
"We want to thank the 300 firefighters that rushed to the
scene and are doing good action to rescue the injured
people from the wreckage. And we also want to thank
the medical personnel who tended the injured."
</P>
<P>
Glendale Mayor Bob Yousefian urged the federal government to provide funding
to enhance grade crossings, while expressing shock and sadness at
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing of this magnitude has happened (before) in Glendale," he said.
"He just came to Glendale to commit suicide. And we
have no idea why he did this."
