MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN TRAIN WRECK
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County prosecutors on Thursday charged a
man with 11 counts of murder, one for every person
who died in a violent three-train wreck that they say
he caused by driving his Jeep onto commuter railroad tracks
in a botched suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
The charges include the special circumstances of using the train, which
could make the man, Juan M. Alvarez, eligible for the
death penalty. Alvarez may also face federal charges in the
train derailment.
</P>
<P>
He was to stand in court on Thursday afternoon and answer
the charges, but his appearance was postponed until Friday because
he was too weak from wounds he made to his
wrists and chest before the wreck, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said in an
interview that he would not decide whether to seek the
death penalty until the case was thoroughly reviewed by his
office.
</P>
<P>
His voice firm with anger, Cooley called Alvarez a self-centered man
whose aborted suicide attempt on the Glendale railroad crossing led
to 11 deaths in the early morning darkness Wednesday. Another
200 people were injured. The body of one man was
burned so badly it has yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
"Because this man was distressed, 11 people are dead from his
selfishness," Cooley said. "They said he was not well enough
to appear today. Hopefully, they will patch him up so
we can get this case rolling."
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 25, was being held in a special custody ward at
an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
As the diesel fuel dissipated at the crash site and the
investigation became a clean-up operation, a clearer portrait of Alvarez
emerged.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, Alvarez is an itinerant laborer with no fixed
address. When detectives asked him to volunteer to a search
of his residence, Alvarez said he did not have one,
that he had been bouncing from couch to couch since
he had a falling out with his wife, Carmelita.
</P>
<P>
She filed a restraining order against him two months ago, alleging
that he was prone to drug-induced hysteria. More than once,
his wife said in papers filed with the court, he
threatened to kidnap the couple's children; a girl, 6 and
a boy, 2. He threatened to sell his Jeep to
buy a gun, promising Mrs. Alvarez's brother, Ruben Ochoa, that
he would be the primary target of his anger, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Alvarez, 25, has a history of drug arrests and violence.
He has been in and out of rehabilitation facilities over
the years. Increasingly, his behavior became more odd and paranoid,
his wife said in court papers, and she said he
accused her of participating in pornographic videos.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Alvarez got an order of protection against him in December,
forbidding him to see his children. Mr. Alvarez began to
threaten suicide to friends, investigators said. Late Tuesday evening or
early Wednesday, Mr. Alvarez cut his arms and stabbed himself
in the chest but the wounds were so superficial, he
remained conscious. He drove onto the railroad tracks in Glendale,
not far from the Los Angeles City line. Investigators believe
that Mr. Alvarez wanted to die under the wheels of
the train, but when the end approached he reconsidered. With
his tire, apparently caught between the tracks, Mr. Alvarez jumped
out of the Jeep and ran.
</P>
<P>
"He chickened out," said Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County.
Two of Baca's employees died in the collision. "He killed
innocent people but not himself."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board said it would not
conduct a full investigation of the crash because it appeared
to be the result of a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing our standard investigation which would involve determination of
cause," said Paul Schlamm, a spokesman for the agency in
Washington . "We're taking a more limited role here."
</P>
<P>
He said the safety board would review data from recording devices
in the locomotives, including time, speed and the exact location
of the cars' breaking up. He said investigators would also
look at the extent of destruction in the commuter cars
and what might be done to improve chances for survival
in future accidents.
</P>
<P>
The commuter train that struck the car on Wednesday had the
locomotive situated in the rear, pushing rather than pulling the
passenger cars. A federal study in 1996 showed that in
this configuration, the front car is exposed, putting passengers at
particular risk of injuries or death.
</P>
<P>
Mayor James K. Hahn of Los Angeles called for a complete
re-examination of all commuter rail lines to see if further
safety measures were needed or possible after the freakish outcome
to the bungled suicide.
