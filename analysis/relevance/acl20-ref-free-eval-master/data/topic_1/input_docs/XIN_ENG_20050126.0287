<P>
A 25-year-old man was arrested
following Wednesday's commuter train collision that killed at 
least 10 people near downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams said Juan Manuel Alvarez, who
intentionally parked his Jeep on the rail tracks and caused the 
train collision, will be facing at least 10 counts of homicide.
</P>
<P>
A southbound commuter train from Ventura County struck the Jeep
at about 6 a.m. local time and caromed into a stationary freight 
train locomotive before colliding with a northbound commuter train
from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed and hundreds were hurt in the 
crash that also disrupted morning rush hour commuter train traffic.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, who is on the suicide watch list, drove his Jeep 
Cherokee on the tracks, then changed his mind about taking his 
life and fled from the vehicle when the train was approaching.
</P>
<P>
Adams said Alvarez had made some superficial attempts overnight
to kill himself -- slitting his wrists and stabbing his chest -- 
and was treated for those wounds before being booked.
</P>
<P>
According to police records, Alvarez has a previous arrest 
history, possibly involving drugs.
</P>
<P>
"He has been cooperative and he has talked to our investigators,
" Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is accused of leaving a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, 
causing the derailment of one train, which then crashed into 
another.
