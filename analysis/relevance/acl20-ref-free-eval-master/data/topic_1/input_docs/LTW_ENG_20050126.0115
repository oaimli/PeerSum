10 Die in Train Wreck Triggered by Suicide Attempt
</HEADLINE>

GLENDALE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man intent on committing suicide left his car
on a railroad track in Glendale near downtown Los Angeles Wednesday,
where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains,
killing at least 10 people and injuring nearly 200, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicide
in the crash that left train cars mangled and seared. Debris including
seat cushions, bloody towels and luggage discarded by fleeing
passengers littered the area.
</P>
<P>
A southbound commuter train heading to downtown Los Angeles hit the
Jeep Grand Cherokee parked on the tracks, said Glendale Police Chief
Randy G. Adams. The train then apparently crashed into a northbound
Metrolink commuter train, and a stationary Union Pacific freight train
was hit and knocked off the tracks, officials said. The investigation
was continuing.
</P>
<P>
Adams identified the suspect as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of
Compton, adding that he had attempted suicide before.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, who was identified by witnesses at the scene, was detained
there and appeared to have superficial self-inflicted injuries
unrelated to the crash.
</P>
<P>
Distraught and remorseful, Alvarez told police he had left the
vehicle and watched the derailment, Adams said. The suspect was put on
a suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was held on 10 counts of murder, Adams said, although
formal charges are lodged by the district attorney's office. Alvarez,
who will be 26 on Feb. 26, had previous drug arrests, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
It is too early to say exactly what those charges will be, District
Attorney Steve Cooley said, but they could include multiple counts of
murder, with special circumstances based on the number of deaths and
nature of the crime. Key to the legal case, Cooley said, ``is the
intent of the individual when he drove onto the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
Adams said of Alvarez: ``I think his intent at that time was to
take his own life, but changed his mind prior to the train actually
striking this vehicle. He exited the vehicle and stood by as the
southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to
derail and strike the northbound train.''
</P>
<P>
Glendale Mayor Bob Yousefian said that Alvarez ``kind of ran, tried
to hide, but because of his previous injuries, he got apprehended.''
</P>
<P>
When asked why Alvarez was in Glendale, the mayor responded, ``He
came to Glendale to commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
A National Transportation Safety Board team was headed to the
scene. The Glendale Police Department was leading the criminal
investigation, with Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department assisting.
</P>
<P>
The 6 a.m. crash set off minor fires and diesel fuel spills as
rescuers rushed to the scene about four miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
``This is unbelievably tragic,'' Sheriff Lee Baca told reporters at
the scene. ``It is a complete outrage as far as transportation safety
is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Los Angeles Police Chief William
Bratton and Glendale's Adams, Baca said he was especially upset
because one of the dead was identified as Deputy James Tutino, a
23-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department. He was aboard the
southbound train, heading to work.
</P>
<P>
Three LAPD employees were hospitalized, and one was unaccounted
for, Bratton said.
</P>
<P>
By 10:30 a.m. the death count hit 10. Fire officials said 123
people were treated and transported to 13 area hospitals. About 60
people were treated at the scene and released.

</P>
<P>
Glendale Memorial Hospital treated 13 passengers. Eight were
treated and released. Two were listed in critical condition, including
Theresa Gillen.
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Leah Gillen, 35, waited at the hospital for news about
her sister, who works for Para Los Ninos, a social-services agency in
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Gillen lashed out at Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
``I'm angry that someone would be so selfish and would destroy the
lives of so many people,'' Leah Gillen said. ``These people were just
going to work.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tons of wreckage from the commuter trains lay strewn
across the area. Officials reported traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 firefighters combed through the derailed trains
looking for trapped passengers in the predawn darkness. As
firefighters cleared each car, they marked the side, giving the cars
an eerie look as they formed a twisted zig-zag pattern next to the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
At least five passes had been completed through the trains by 9
a.m., when officials said the focus shifted from rescue to recovery.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the trains usually carried 200 to 250 passengers.
The top speed is 79 mph, although the trains were believed to be
traveling at less than the maximum.
</P>
<P>
David Morrison, 47, an attorney, was heading to downtown Los
Angeles on his regular morning commute. He said he got on train 100 at
5:19 a.m. in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
``I heard the crash. It sounded like the train was dragging
something across the tracks,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. ``There
was a violent lurch and everything came to a stop.''
</P>
<P>
He said the passengers fled amid the smell of diesel fumes.
</P>
<P>
Goddard Paialii, 53, of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, a
communications electrician for the city of Los Angeles, said he
boarded the train and rode in the lead car. He was upstairs and said
he was trying to nap, listening to his iPod.
</P>
<P>
After the crash, the train ``appeared to be dragging whatever it
hit. At that point, I just braced myself. Computers, seat pads,
briefcases were flying all over. There was lots of smoke in the car.''
</P>
<P>
But the exodus remained orderly.
</P>
<P>
Cathie Fransen, 57, was riding with her friend Ken Milds, 55, in
the middle car. Fransen said she has taken the train regularly for 12
1/2 years and was in the aisle seat, second floor, middle car. She
does community relations for IBM in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
``It was very terrifying. We had seconds to think about what was
going on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The entire wreck of all three trains was contained between a gray
warehouse and the brick wall of a Costco warehouse store.
</P>
<P>
All along the ground, large metal pieces of the side of the train
and gray upholstered seats were scattered like discarded food
wrappers. On the train cars, windows gaped or were shattered in their
frames.
</P>
<P>
``We heard a loud boom and the building shook,'' said Jenny Doll,
30, a Costco clerk.
</P>
<P>
Employees took fire extinguishers from the store shelves and ran
outside to help.
</P>
<P>
Inside the store, passengers were processed by officials trying to
account for everyone on board. Once done, the commuters filed out and
sat on white picnic benches in front of a snack stand.
</P>
<P>
An hour after the crash, crews worked on the wreckage as about 50
passengers waited nearby.
