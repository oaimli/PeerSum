SUSPECT TRIED SUICIDE AFTER DEADLY TRAIN CRASH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GLENDALE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juan Miguel Alvarez, charged with murder with special
circumstances in the deaths of 11 Metrolink passengers, slashed and
stabbed himself after seeing the horrific train crash he caused,
sources close to the investigation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 25, despondent over the breakup of his marriage, had planned
to kill himself when he drove his green Jeep Grand
Cherokee in the path of a Metrolink train, officials said,
but he bolted from the vehicle at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
As he watched, southbound Train No. 100 smashed into the SUV
and derailed, then rammed a parked Union Pacific freight train
and collided with another Metrolink train heading north out of
Union Station.
</P>
<P>
As onlookers and emergency crews rushed to help those trapped in
the flaming wreckage, Alvarez walked to a female friend's home
in nearby Atwater Village, where he slashed his wrists and
stabbed himself in the chest, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have done further investigation, we know the self-inflicted
wounds were received after he placed the car on the
tracks and after he fled from the scene," one source
said. "When paramedics responded, that's how we became aware of
his location."
</P>
<P>
Alvarez appeared remorseful, sources said, making spontaneous statements about the crash
to paramedics and law-enforcement officials who responded to the friend's
911 call.
</P>
<P>
Eleven people died and about 180 were injured in the crash
at 6:02 a.m. Wednesday. Seven people remained in critical condition
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the crash, Alvarez was arrested on suspicion of
murder. He is being held without bail at Los Angeles
County/USC Medical Center jail ward, where he is being treated
for the self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was charged early Thursday with 10 counts of murder with
the special circumstances of multiple murders and murder caused by
train derailment, an extremely rare charge. After the body of
an 11th victim was discovered, District Attorney Steve Cooley said
another murder count would be added to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
The special circumstances could make Alvarez eligible for the death penalty
if he is convicted, but Cooley said he hadn't yet
decided whether to pursue the capital charges.
</P>
<P>
The Alvarez family retained attorney Eric A. Chase of the Chase
Law Group in Studio City to represent him. Chase and
fellow attorney Debra S. White said they expect Alvarez's arraignment,
originally scheduled for Thursday, to be held Friday.
</P>
<P>
In filing the charges, Cooley said he was unmoved by Alvarez's
emotional state before the crash.
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to engage my sympathy because he was despondent,"
Cooley said. "The special circumstances alleged could lead to the
death penalty but only after a careful evaluation of all
the facts and circumstances that related to the particular incident.
We're all aware of Mr. Alvarez's background."
</P>
<P>
But legal observers predicted Cooley will have a hard time getting
a conviction on the special circumstances allegations because he would
have to prove that Alvarez intended to kill people on
the train. Statements by law enforcement officials that the train
crash was the result of an aborted suicide attempt don't
support that notion, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It suggests to me that he didn't have an intent to
kill," said Elyn Saks, a professor of law, psychology and
psychiatry in behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, just putting the car there on the
tracks was extremely reckless."
</P>
<P>
Saks said prosecutors might do better to charge Alvarez with "depraved
heart" murder, the equivalent of second-degree murder, rather than more
serious first-degree charges.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys also said statements made by Sheriff Lee Baca, Los Angeles
Mayor James Hahn and others that Alvarez was "deranged" and
a "crazed individual" will not help defense attorneys in a
possible insanity defense to spare him a potential death sentence.
</P>
<P>
James E. Blatt, a high-profile criminal defense attorney based in Encino,
said it seemed obvious that Alvarez was mentally ill and
disabled, but that there was a much higher standard concerning
an insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
"He did have enough wherewithal to jump out of the way
of the train to preserve his life," Blatt said. "He
appears remorseful. And at first blush, he appears to understand
the consequences of his actions."
</P>
<P>
As grieving friends and families mourned the deaths of their loved
ones, city, state and federal investigators continued to comb through
the massive pile of debris and twisted metal at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
"It's been an extremely long and difficult two days with the
rescue and recovery of victims in this tragic accident," Glendale
police Sgt. Tom Lorenz said. "All emergency personnel working through
these tough times are not only trying to get victims
reunited with their loved ones, but at the back of
their minds know they have fellow employees who were injured
or died.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure we do a very thorough job."
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board has assigned 10 investigators to assist
the Glendale Police Department.
</P>
<P>
"They will spend the next few weeks looking at documenting different
aspects of the event like the crash-worthiness of the (rail)
cars and survivability issues like how people were injured and
what might be done to protect them better," agency spokesman
Paul Schlamm said.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to learn as much as we can from this."
