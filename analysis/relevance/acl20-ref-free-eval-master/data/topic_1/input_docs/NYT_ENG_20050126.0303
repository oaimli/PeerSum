POLICE TELL OF A TROUBLED, SUICIDAL MAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
COMPTON, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until Wednesday, Juan Manuel Alvarez was living the
average life of an obscure and troubled man.
</P>
<P>
He has an arrest record for cocaine, a turbulent relationship with
his estranged wife and a restraining order to keep away
from her and their two children.
</P>
<P>
But then in the early morning darkness of Wednesday, Alvarez introduced
his troubled life to the world when he drove his
Jeep Cherokee onto the commuter railroad tracks of Glendale in
metropolitan Los Angeles, killing at least 10 people and injuring
about 200 more.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Watson came to the Glendale Police Station on Wednesday morning
to find some information on his wife.
</P>
<P>
He was told she was taken to the hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
"I heard what happened this morning, and I thought it can't
be her," said Watson, visibly relieved. "It was. Thank God
nothing serious happened to her. She's home now. She's going
to be mad I didn't pick her up."
</P>
<P>
Alvarez had apparently meant to kill himself, investigators said, but changed
his mind when he saw the train barreling down on
him. When he could not get his vehicle off the
tracks, he ran. He was in police custody Wednesday evening,
said to be distraught but cooperating.
</P>
<P>
"He's carrying a lot of baggage and talked about killing himself,"
said Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County. "When the
train came, he got scared, he couldn't go through with
it. He left his car there and instead of killing
himself, he killed many innocent people."
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's motive for wanting to kill himself, according to investigators, appears
to be that his estranged wife, Carmelita, would not let
him see their two children. The couple had separated three
months ago, and she obtained a restraining order against Alvarez
about two months ago, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's sister-in-law, Maricela Amaya, told Telemundo TV that he had recently
tried to see his boy and threatened to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
"He was having problems with drugs and all that and was
violent, and because of that he separated from her," Amaya
said in Spanish. "A few other times he went around
as if he wanted to kill himself."
</P>
<P>
After the bodies had been cleared from the wreckage, law-enforcement officials
began to wonder if Alvarez might have killed his family.
But, Mrs. Alvarez was tracked to a modest home in
the north section of Compton. A man standing outside the
family's home, who described himself as a relative, said Mrs.
Alvarez and the children were uninjured.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, Alvarez spent the evening before slashing his wrists
and even stabbed himself in the chest, but the wounds
were superficial.
</P>
<P>
And so sometime Wednesday morning, Alvarez, 25, drove himself to the
Glendale tracks, near the City of Los Angeles boundary and
parked his car. He decided not to go through with
it, but the vehicle got stuck between the tracks, the
police said. Alvarez ran to safety and watched the carnage
he had caused, witnesses told the police.
</P>
<P>
"He came to Glendale to commit suicide," said Bob Yousefian, mayor
of Glendale, a normally uneventful city of 210,000 just north
of Los Angeles City Hall. "He kind of ran, tried
to hide, but because of his previous injuries, he got
apprehended."
</P>
<P>
Chief Randy G. Adams of the Glendale police said he was
"very confident" that he had the right man, going by
Alvarez's own admissions and witnesses on the train who saw
him run.
</P>
<P>
"This whole incident was started by a deranged individual that was
suicidal," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is likely to face at least 10 counts of murder,
the chief said.
