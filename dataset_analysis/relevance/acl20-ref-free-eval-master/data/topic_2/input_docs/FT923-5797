SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans.
</p>
<p>
However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.
</p>
<p>
Federal emergency officials acknowledged distribution problems, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card yesterday promised 'dramatic' improvements within 24 hours and President George Bush last night ordered troops to Florida, without specifying a number.
</p>
<p>
The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm.
</p>
<p>
Louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to help Louisiana recover.
</p>
<p>
Most of the storm's fury was spent against sparsely populated farming communities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespread destruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died.
</p>
<p>
Official estimates in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one Dade County resident in eight - a quarter of a million people.
</p>
<p>
Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday, moving across Mississippi state and heading for the north-eastern US.
</p>
<p>
Several of Louisiana's main industries were affected, including those of oysters and alligators.
</p>
<p>
Wildlife and fisheries secretary Joe Herring estimated a 50 per cent decline in the alligator industry.
</p>
<p>
The cotton and sugar-cane crops were threatened, the state agriculture department said.
</p>
<p>
Most Louisiana oil refineries, however, were barely affected and deliveries of crude oil were expected to resume yesterday.
