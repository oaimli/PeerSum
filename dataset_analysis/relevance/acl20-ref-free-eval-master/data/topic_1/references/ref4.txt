A train crash in Glendale, California, on 26 January killed 11 people and injured close to 200, many critically. A southbound commuter train, pushed from behind by a locomotive, hit an SUV lodged on the tracks, then hit a freight train and a northbound commuter train. Police arrested Juan Manuel Alvarez, the driver of the SUV, who had jumped from the car just before the impact. At first, self-inflicted wounds on his wrists and chest led investigators to think that it was an attempted suicide. It was determined later that he got the wounds after he fled the scene.
