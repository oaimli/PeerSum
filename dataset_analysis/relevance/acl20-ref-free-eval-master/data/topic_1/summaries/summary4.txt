Los Angeles County prosecutors on Thursday charged a man with 11 counts of murder, one for every person who died in a violent three-train wreck that they say he caused by driving the man's Jeep onto commuter railroad tracks in a botched suicide attempt. Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicide in the crash that left train cars mangled and seared. At 6:02 a.m., the three-car Train 100, headed from Moorpark to Union Station, with the locomotive in the rear, crashed into the SUV.
