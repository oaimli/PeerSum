At Least 10 Dead in Train Crash North of L.A.

At least 10 people were killed and more than 180
injured Wednesday when a commuter train derailed after crashing into a
car parked on tracks north of Los Angeles, then sideswiped an oncoming
train, knocking it off its rails.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the SUV, a Jeep Cherokee, was left on the tracks
by an apparently suicidal man, who jumped from the vehicle moments
before the southbound commuter train plowed into it.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst train wreck in the United States since March 1999,
when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed in Illinois, killing 11
people and injuring about 100. In the deadliest train wreck in recent
years, an Amtrak train plunged off a railroad bridge near Mobile,
Ala., in September 1993, killing 47 people.
</P>
<P>
The SUV was hit shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific time by a southbound
Metrolink train, which then went off the rails and started a deadly
chain reaction, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
After derailing, the commuter train, which was being pushed by its
engine, struck a Union Pacific locomotive parked on a side track,
knocking it onto its side, fire department officials said. The
commuter train, en route to Union Station in Los Angeles from the
western suburb of Moorpark, then buckled, sideswiping a passing
northbound train that was headed toward Burbank.
</P>
<P>
Diesel fuel in the locomotive caught fire as a result of the crash,
and flames spread to parts of the wreckage before firefighters
extinguished them.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the SUV, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of
Compton, Calif., was taken into custody, and police said he would be
charged with homicide. Further information was not available. They
said the abortive suicide attempt did not involve terrorism.
</P>
<P>
``This is a complete outrage,'' Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca
angrily told reporters at the scene of mangled rail cars and smoking
wreckage in the suburb of Glendale, north of downtown Los Angeles. He
said the driver would be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
``You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm's
way and all these passengers in harm's way,'' Baca said. Among the
dead was a deputy in Baca's department who was riding the southbound
train to work. In a light drizzle, rescue workers paused to salute the
flag-draped stretcher carrying the body of Deputy James Tutino as it
was removed from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
``This whole incident was started by a deranged individual that was
suicidal,'' Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told a news conference.
``I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but (he)
changed his mind prior to the train actually striking the vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
Just hours before maneuvering his car onto the tracks, Alvarez had
twice tried to kill himself, slashing his wrists and stabbing himself
in the chest, police said. When those attempts failed, they said, he
got into his car and headed for the tracks behind a Costco store.
</P>
<P>
Several train passengers said they saw Alvarez jump from his SUV
just before the southbound train plowed into the vehicle, Adams said.
Approximately 250 people were aboard the two commuter trains traveling
in opposite directions at the beginning of the morning rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers initially thought Alvarez was a victim of the train
wreck when they found him wandering near the scene, bleeding from his
wrists and chest. But he was arrested after saying he was the driver
of the SUV that was struck by the train.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'' he muttered as he walked around the crash
site, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was taken to USC Medical Center for treatment of his
self-inflicted wounds, and police moved to book him on 10 counts of
homicide. Adams described him as ``upset, remorseful but
cooperative.'' The police chief said Alvarez has a criminal record
involving drugs.
</P>
<P>
The force of the crash hurled passengers down the aisles and into
tables as the rail cars twisted and turned before finally coming to
rest. At least one train car caught fire.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 123 people were taken to 15 hospitals in the
region and that about 40 were in critical condition. About 60 people
were treated at the scene and released.
