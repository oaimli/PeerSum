Ten people were killed and 
more than 100 injured Wednesday when two commuter trains slammed 
into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a 
suicidal man, police said.
</P>
<P>
A murder investigation was launched as the death toll rose 
following the horrific early morning crash involving three trains 
and a sports utility vehicle in the heavily-populated Los Angeles 
suburb of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were picking through the mangled wreckage of the trains 
that collided with an explosive crash just after 6:00 am (1400 GMT) 
after one of them derailed as it ploughed into the abandoned 
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
"We have 10 fatalities so far and well over 100 injured," 
Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told reporters, adding that the 
probe into the accident had turned into a homicide investigation.
</P>
<P>
"This whole incident was started by a deranged individual who 
was suicidal," he said announcing that the depressed driver, 
identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, was unhurt and was in 
custody.
</P>
<P>
The driver allegedly manoeuvred his Jeep onto the tracks, where 
it became stuck, and waited for a train to end his life, according 
to Adams and other police officials.  
</P>
<P>
"He was intent at that time on taking his own life but changed 
his mind," Adams told reporters.    "He exited the vehicle and stood 
by as a southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the 
train to derail and strike the northbound train," the police chief 
said.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the car, the packed rush-hour train, which was 
bound for Los Angeles' Union Station, jumped its tracks and 
jack-knifed into the path of an oncoming commuter train heading in 
the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stricken trains then side-swiped a stationary freight 
train that was parked on a side-track in the area, knocking it over, 
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Carnage ensued. "It sounded like thunder," said Karen Mendoza, 
an employee at a nearby wholesale store who called emergency 
services when she heard the accident.
</P>
<P>
Some passengers had to be cut from the wreckage, which was 
strewn over a wide area, while others were forced to jump to safety 
from the burning upper decks of railway carriages that caught fire 
in the impact. 
</P>
<P>
At least 89 people were rushed to hospital as a hundreds of 
rescuers and convoys of ambulances flooded the crash scene. 
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people, mostly walking wounded, were examined by 
medical staff at the scene as they prioritised treatment for the 
wounded, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were tossed around the inside of their trains and 
some had to jump from the upper decks of the wreckage, eyewitnesses 
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injuries suffered by victims were "crush-type" 
wounds similar to those that occur in car crashes, said Carol Meyer 
of the Los Angeles County emergency medical services. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the patients had head, chest and abdominal injuries, she 
added.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department declared a citywide tactical 
alert that allows commanders to keep officers on the job beyond the 
end of their shifts, in order to help with the rescue and crowd 
control operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the driver of the vehicle that sparked the incident 
was expected to be charged with murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm's 
way and all these passengers in harm's way," said Los Angeles 
Sheriff Lee Baca, one of whose deputies was among the dead. "This is 
a complete outrage."
