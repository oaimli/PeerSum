AT LEAST 10 DEAD, NEARLY 200 HURT IN 3-TRAIN WRECK IN CALIFORNIA; SUSPECT IS HELD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GLENDALE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man whom police described as deranged and
bent on suicide abandoned a light truck on a heavily
traveled commuter rail track here early Wednesday, causing a violent
wreck involving three trains that left at least 10 people
dead and nearly 200 injured.
</P>
<P>
The fierce collision at 6:02 a.m. left rail cars toppled and
crushed like oversized toys and sparked immediate fears among Los
Angeles-area police that the derailment was a terrorist act. A
counterterrorism command post was set up near the crash site,
but authorities determined within an hour that the disaster was
almost certainly the work of one troubled man.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the crash, the rain-spattered scene between a Costco
store and a warehouse still reeked of diesel fuel. The
tracks were covered with tons of twisted metal and littered
with rail car seats, suitcases, briefcases and clothing. A bicycle
lay on its side and the gravel rail bed was
stained with oil and blood.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers arrived quickly and were aided by Costco employees who
pulled injured passengers from the smoking wreckage. More than 120
people, dozens of them with serious injuries, were transported to
15 area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"People were screaming, one lady was crying, people were moaning, all
kinds of painful noises," said Richard Mendevil, who was on
his way home to Santa Clarita from Los Angeles' Union
Station in the northbound Metrolink train, when it was hit
by a southbound train that had derailed after hitting the
light truck and an idle Union Pacific work train.
</P>
<P>
Glendale police said that Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of the Los
Angeles suburb of Compton, drove around barriers at a grade
crossing and then up the Metrolink commuter rail tracks, where
his Jeep Grand Cherokee became wedged between the rails.
</P>
<P>
He apparently changed his mind about killing himself, abandoned the vehicle
and watched the crash, the Glendale police chief, Randy G.
Adams, said.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that before driving onto the tracks Alvarez cut his
wrists and stabbed himself in the chest, inflicting superficial wounds.
He was treated for his injuries and taken into custody
and will be charged with at least 10 counts of
murder, the chief said. He said the crash was caused
solely by the actions of the suspect. He and other
law enforcement officials expressed dismay and anger at what they
called a preventable man-made disaster.
</P>
<P>
"I think his intent at that time was to take his
own life, but changed his mind prior to the train
actually striking this vehicle," Adams said. "He exited the vehicle
and stood by as the southbound Metrolink train struck his
vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound
train."
</P>
<P>
He said that Alvarez was cooperating with authorities and had acknowledged
causing the wreck.
</P>
<P>
"He was very distraught and upset when he realized he caused
a major disaster," the chief said. Alvarez is in jail
and under suicide watch, he added.
</P>
<P>
Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said he would
decide by the end of the week what charges he
will bring against Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
Metrolink is a commuter rail system serving five counties in Southern
California since its formation in 1992. About 40,000 people ride
the double-decker trains every day, officials said. The two trains
that crashed on Wednesday typically carry between 230 and 300
people on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's crash was the deadliest train accident in the United States
since March 15, 1999, when an Amtrak train hit a
truck and derailed near Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people. A
crash in Graniteville, S.C., earlier this month ruptured a chlorine
tank, leaving nine people dead and 234 injured.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate.
People on the train and in the neighborhood near the
tracks saw Alvarez as he ran away from his vehicle.
Slowed by his knife wounds, he was arrested quickly, police
said.

Witnesses and survivors described a horrific collision that upended several double-decker
rail cars and toppled a heavy diesel Union Pacific locomotive
sitting idle on a side track.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a noise. It got louder and louder," Diane Brady,
56, a passenger from Simi Valley, told the Associated Press.
"And next thing I knew the train tilted, everyone was
screaming and I held onto a pole for dear life.
I held on for what seemed like a week and
a half, it seemed. It was a complete nightmare."
</P>
<P>
One injured man trapped in the wreckage scrawled a note in
his own blood on a seat cushion, according to Rex
Vilaubi, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. He wrote "I
love my kids" and "I love Leslie" using the heart
symbol, Vilaubi said. He said he did not know the
man's name.

Mendevil, who was in the second car of the northbound train,
said the collision came with no warning. "I was on
the second floor walking down the aisle and saw the
lights of the oncoming train and watched it pass and
then I was thrown up in the air, landed on
a table and rolled off onto the floor," he said.
"The train tilted sideways and the lights flickered and went
out."
</P>
<P>
He said as he got up from the floor he saw
a fire on the tracks and a man with blood
streaming down his face staggering alongside the listing rail car.
Mendevil said that although he was "pretty much in panic,"
he pried open a door and helped a woman out
and away from the train.
</P>
<P>
Mendevil, 25, was interviewed in the parking lot of the Costco
store that became a command center and triage station for
the crash. He was wearing a tag around his neck
given to him by paramedics to keep track of the
injured. He was treated at the scene and sent home.
</P>
<P>
Mendevil said as he walked away from the wreckage, he saw
the tailgate of a truck and a wheel and concluded
that the train had hit a car or truck. "I
got as far away as I could because I was
worried about an explosion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Costco workers attended to the injured and used carts that usually
haul plywood to carry the injured to ambulances when paramedics
ran out of gurneys. The store provided food and water
for the hundreds of fire and rescue crews and media
workers who descended on the crash site in the damp
gloomy dawn.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters went through the wreckage five times with dogs and listening
devices before determining that all the passengers had been accounted
for. Heavy equipment was then brought in to begin to
clear the tracks, a process that will take several days,
officials said.

Among the dead was Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy James Tutino,
47, a 23-year veteran of the department, who was commuting
to downtown Los Angeles from his home in Simi Valley.
Two other sheriff's deputies aboard the train were injured.
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete outrage as far as traffic safety is
concerned," Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said. "When some
individual parks his vehicle on the tracks that is cause
for serious, serious alarm."

Mayor Bob Yousefian of Glendale called on federal transportation authorities to
eliminate all grade crossings, which are responsible for scores of
accidents and suicides each year around the country.
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators said they did not know the exact number of
motorists who have committed suicides at rail crossings. The police
who investigate rail accidents are taught to look for signs
of suicide, such as an absence of skid marks immediately
before the crossing, indicating that the motorist saw the train
and tried to stop. Suicides more commonly involve pedestrians who
walk in front of trains than those who park cars
on the tracks, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's crash was the third fatal accident involving Metrolink in the
past three years. In January 2003, a Metrolink train smashed
into a truck and derailed, killing the motorist and injuring
32 train passengers. In April 2002, a freight train plowed
into a stopped Metrolink train, leaving three passengers dead and
162 injured.
</P>
<P>
David Solow, the chief executive officer of Metrolink, described how the
disaster unfolded. Metrolink train 100, a four-car train being pushed
by a locomotive, was southbound from Moorpark to Los Angeles
and approaching the Glendale station at 6:02 a.m. when its
front car hit Alvarez's Jeep.
</P>
<P>
The front car, a so-called cab car, has a compartment in
the front for the engineer when the locomotive is in
the back. The rest of the two-story car carries passengers.
</P>
<P>
Because Alvarez's truck was wedged between the rails and not sitting
at a grade crossing, it became an "immovable object," Solow
said, vaulting the front car of the train into the
air and causing the cars behind it to twist on
their couplings and fold in on each other like an
accordion.
</P>
<P>
The out-of-control train struck an idle Union Pacific work train on
a track just west of the Metrolink rails, knocking the
locomotive on its side. The train had numerous cars full
of gravel and was preparing to go to Santa Barbara
to repair tracks damaged in the recent California rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
After striking the Union Pacific train, the southbound train slammed into
an oncoming Metrolink train, number 901, northbound from Los Angeles
to the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
Trains on the line can travel as fast as 79 mph,
but the two trains involved in the crash were probably
going slower because the southbound train was approaching the Glendale
station and the northbound train had just left it, Solow
said. He said that the exact speeds, the various points
of impact and the overall force of the collision would
be determined by National Transportation Safety Board investigators.
</P>
<P>
Solow said that Metrolink and most other passenger trains were designed
to withstand a collision with a light vehicle stopped at
a grade crossing. The cab car in the front of
the southbound train has a reinforced frame that is designed
to deflect or destroy vehicles parked at level grade crossings.
</P>
<P>
"Normally at a grade crossing the car is smashed to smithereens
and the train stays on the track," Solow said. "But
this car was wedged between the tracks and the only
way for the cab car to go was up."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
He said that Metrolink is involved in three to five grade
crossing accidents a year, some involving attempted or successful suicides.
</P>
<P>
"If someone wants to commit suicide," Solow said, "I don't care
if it's on a highway, a railroad or jumping off
a bridge, none of us is going to stop that.
It's one of the banes of our existence."
