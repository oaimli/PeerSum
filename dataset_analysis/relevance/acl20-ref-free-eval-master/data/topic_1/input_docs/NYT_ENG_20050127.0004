<P>
Authorities believe Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his Jeep
Grand Cherokee around the rail crossing barrier and onto the
Metrolink train tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale about
6 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His intent was to kill himself, but he changed his mind
after his SUV got stuck between the tracks in an
area slightly away from the grade crossing.
</P>
<P>
At 6:02 a.m., the three-car Train 100, headed from Moorpark to
Union Station, with the locomotive in the rear, crashed into
the SUV. Instead of knocking it out of the way,
the train's front cab car probably lifted up over the
SUV, said Metrolink's CEO Dave Solow.
</P>
<P>
Because the SUV was "lodged on the tracks," it was unable
to move, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It got wedged under the train. At grade crossing, it would
have been easier. He would have been pushed off."
</P>
<P>
The commuter train folded up like an accordion -- its front
car ramming into the Union Pacific freight train's locomotive on
the track to the west, toppling it to its side.
The remaining cars collided with northbound Metrolink Train 901, which
was on the track to the east after leaving the
Glendale Station.
</P>
<P>
The Union Pacific train was a work train for track maintenance,
with two locomotives and about 12 cars filled with ballast
or gravel.
</P>
<P>
Metrolink trains in that area can go up to 79 mph,
but officials said they were likely going slower with the
Glendale station nearby.
</P>
<P>
Solow said there's little Metrolink can do to prevent suicide attempts
on its tracks.
</P>
<P>
"One of the banes of our existence is we can't stop
someone who wants to commit suicide."
